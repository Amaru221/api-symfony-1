# API Platform 3!🐉
## Setup

To get it working, follow these steps:

### Download Composer dependencies

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

### Install Assets
Install the assets
Run:

```
npm install 
```
- or yarn install

### Compile assets
For dev - Run:
```
npm run watch
```

For production - Run:
```
npm run build
```
### Start the Symfony web server

You can use Nginx or Apache, but Symfony's local web server
works even better.

To install the Symfony local web server, follow
"Downloading the Symfony client" instructions found
here: https://symfony.com/download - you only need to do this
once on your system.

Then, to start the web server, open a terminal, move into the
project, and run:

```
symfony serve
```

(If this is your first time using this command, you may see an
error that you need to run `symfony server:ca:install` first).
